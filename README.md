> [SecretHub][secrethub] is a secrets management tool that works for every engineer. Securely provision passwords and keys throughout your entire stack with just a few lines of code.

This repository contains code examples for integrations with SecretHub. The README.md for these examples can be found in every directory. For all integrations, take a look at the [integrations page](https://secrethub.io/docs/#integrations).

We're adding more examples over time (starting with the ones listed below), so keep a lookout for new examples. We'll be adding the ones listed here first.

If you have a great example of a SecretHub integration yourself or a way to improve an example, feel free (and very welcome) to make a pull request.
